   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your API key:

   ```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize the benchmark:

```yaml
# Models to test (copy names from OpenRouter - openrouter.ai/models)
models_to_test:
  - qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-instruct
  - qwen/qwen3-vl-8b-instruct
  - openai/gpt-4.1-mini
  - openai/gpt-5.2

# OpenRouter settings
openrouter:
  base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
  timeout: 60
  max_concurrent_requests: 5 # Parallel requests per model (increase for speed)

# Scoring weights for components
scoring_weights:
  base: 0.15
  wall: 0.15
  tall: 0.15
  loft: 0.15
  dado: 0.05
  floor: 0.05
  colors: 0.20
  handles: 0.10
```

**Performance Tips:**

- Increase `max_concurrent_requests` (5-10) for faster benchmarking
- Be mindful of API rate limits per model
- More workers = faster but higher chance of rate limiting

## Usage

### Run the Benchmark

```bash
uv run python -m src.main
```

The benchmark will:

1. Discover all sample image/JSON pairs in `Samples/`
2. Test each configured model on each sample
3. Score responses against ground truth using structural comparison
4. Save all responses to `results/{timestamp}/{model_name}/`
5. Generate a comprehensive markdown report at `results/{timestamp}/report.md`

### Understanding the Output

During execution, you'll see:

```
============================================================
Vision LLM Benchmark
============================================================

Found 10 samples
Testing 3 models

Testing model: openai/gpt-4o
============================================================
  Score for Kitchen_01: 87.5%
  Score for Kitchen_02: 92.1%
  ...
```

After completion:

```
Benchmark complete!
Report saved to: results/20260111_143022/report.md
Results saved to: results/20260111_143022
```

## Scoring Methodology

The benchmark uses **structural JSON comparison** with scores displayed as **percentages (0-100%)**.

### Component Scoring

Each kitchen component (base, wall, tall, loft, dado, floor) is scored based on:

- **Detection accuracy** (30%): Boolean match
- **Finish family** (20%): Exact string match
- **Color similarity** (30%): LAB color space Delta E calculation
- **Handle detection** (20%): Type, finish, and color matching

### Color Similarity

Colors are compared using the LAB color space for perceptual accuracy:

- Delta E < 2: Barely perceptible difference (score = 1.0)
- Delta E > 50: Very different colors (score = 0.0)
- Linear interpolation between these values

### Overall Score

The final score is a weighted average of all components using the weights defined in `config.yaml`.

## Report Contents

Generated reports include:

1. **Summary Table**: Average score (%), total cost, average cost per request, and duration per model
2. **Detailed Results**: Per-sample scores (%) and costs with links to response files
3. **Component Analysis**: Average scores (%) for each kitchen component
4. **Best/Worst Samples**: Identify strengths and weaknesses

All scores are displayed as percentages from 0-100% for easy interpretation.

### Cost Metrics

The benchmark tracks two key cost metrics:

- **Total Cost**: Total spent on all samples for that model
- **Avg Cost/Request**: Average cost per API request (total cost ÷ number of samples)

## Generating Ground Truth

The system can automatically generate ground truth JSON files using a high-quality benchmark model.

### Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to specify the benchmark model and generation behavior:

```yaml
# Model to use for generating ground truth
benchmark_model: openai/gpt-5.2

# Ground truth regeneration behavior
ground_truth:
  replace_all: false  # If true, regenerate all existing json files
                      # If false, only generate for samples without json output
```
### Adding More Samples

```bash
python -m src.main --prepare-samples
```
Loops over all images in Samples/ (supports jpg, png, webp, bmp, tiff, gif, heic)
Renames them to kitchen_01.jpg, kitchen_02.jpg, etc.
Uses ffmpeg for jpg conversion
Deletes the original file after successful conversion

### Generate Ground Truth Files

```bash
# Generate ground truth for new samples (skip existing ones)
python -m src.main --generate-ground-truth

# To replace ALL existing ground truth files:
# 1. Set replace_all: true in config.yaml
# 2. Run: uv run python -m src.main --generate-ground-truth
```

The tool will:
- Find all images in the `Samples/` directory
- Generate JSON responses using the benchmark model
- Save them as ground truth files (e.g., `Kitchen_01.json`)
- Skip existing files if `replace_all: false`
- Show progress with ✅ (success), ⏭️ (skipped), or ❌ (error) indicators

### When to Use This

- **Adding new samples**: Place new images in `Samples/`, then run with `replace_all: false`
- **Upgrading ground truth**: Use a better model by changing `benchmark_model` and setting `replace_all: true`
- **Fixing specific samples**: Delete the JSON files you want to regenerate, then run with `replace_all: false`

## Adding New Samples

### Manual Method

1. Place the image in `Samples/` (e.g., `Kitchen_11.jpg`)
2. Create the ground truth JSON (e.g., `Kitchen_11.json`) following the schema
3. Ensure the filename prefix matches (e.g., `Kitchen_11`)
4. Run the benchmark - new samples are automatically discovered

### Automated Method (Recommended)

1. Place the image in `Samples/` (e.g., `Kitchen_11.jpg`)
2. Run ground truth generation: `uv run python -m src.main --generate-ground-truth`
3. The system will automatically create `Kitchen_11.json`
4. Review the generated ground truth file for accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### "OPENROUTER_API_KEY not found"

- Ensure `.env` file exists in the project root
- Verify the API key is properly set in `.env`

### Model errors

- Check that model names in `config.yaml` match OpenRouter's format
- Verify you have sufficient credits in your OpenRouter account
- Some models may have rate limits or availability restrictions

### Color scoring issues

- Ensure hex colors in ground truth are valid `#RRGGBB` format
- Check that color coverage values sum to approximately 100

### What Gets Scored

Each kitchen image is analyzed for 7 components:

1. **Base Cabinets** (15%) - Lower cabinets below the counter
2. **Wall Cabinets** (15%) - Upper cabinets on the wall
3. **Tall Cabinets** (15%) - Full-height units (pantries, etc.)
4. **Loft Cabinets** (15%) - Highest cabinets near the ceiling
5. **Dado/Backsplash** (5%) - Wall covering behind counters
6. **Floor** (5%) - Flooring material
7. **Colors** (20%) - How accurately colors are identified
8. **Handles** (10%) - Hardware type and finish

### For Each Component, We Check:

- **Did the AI see it?** (30%) - Is the component detected?
- **Right material?** (20%) - Correct finish (laminate, wood, etc.)
- **Right colors?** (30%) - How close are the colors?
- **Right hardware?** (20%) - Correct handle type and finish

### Color Matching

Colors are scored using human perception:
- **Identical colors** = 100%
- **Slightly different** = High score (hard to notice)
- **Completely different** = 0%

The system uses LAB color space
